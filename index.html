Artists such as Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino wrote and recorded some of the earliest crossover hits. Soon, white artists such as Bill Haley and the Comets and Pat Boone began recording cover versions of black artists' songs, most of which were more commercially successful than their black counterparts. Changes in technology, new and hybrid musical forms, and shifts in music consumption patterns all contributed to a reworking of the American popular music landscape that would forever alter the history of popular music consumption in the United States.",

        ],
        "full": "The magnetic recording process changed how music was recorded and distributed. Developed by the Germans to guide radio-controlled V-2 bombs, magnetic tape allowed for sound to be recorded, erased, and re-recorded on the same tape many times, allowed for recordings to be duplicated from tape to tape, allowed for recordings to be edited, and made recording much cheaper. Recording was no longer confined to gigantic and elaborate studios owned by the major companies in a few big cities. Tolerably decent recordings could now be made anywhere by untrained personnel who knew very little about engineering or acoustics. Around the same time, high fidelity 45 RPM technology exploded onto the scene. 45 RPMs were inexpensive to produce and to purchase. It was in the world of 45 RPM singles that rhythm and blues had its first great moment in pop music history. Music listening and consumption was also affected by the radio. The transistor radio, developed by Bell Laboratory in 1947, appeared on the market in the early 1950s. About the same time, the car radio became an affordable option in the automobile industry, and people began listening to the radio in their cars as well as in their homes. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, many popular talk, drama, and comedy radio programs had moved from radio to television, and radio programmers needed to find new material to fill the airtime. Several innovations in radio programming arose, the most important of which was the development of the Top 40 radio format. Top 40 became the new radio format. The same forty songs would be repeated every 24-hour radio cycle, and the top ten songs would receive more frequent play than the bottom thirty. Why forty tunes? Because the Wurlitzer jukeboxes, which flooded the industry at the time, contained forty recordings.",

The most important disc jockey of the era, and indeed, one of the most important figures in the promotion of early rock and roll, was Alan Freed. Freed was the most influential disc jockey of early rock and roll. He began his radio career in 1946 in Akron, Ohio before moving to Cleveland in 1951. He soon transformed his evening classical-music program into The Moondog Show, which featured rhythm and blues records by black artists. He dubbed the music 'rock and roll'—a term used in African American music since the 1930s as a euphemism for sex—and the name stuck. The new music was a hit for teenagers, and Freed soon gained an immense radio following. In addition to champion rock and roll on the radio, Freed also organized rock and roll concerts that drew large crowd of both black and white teenagers. His success in Cleveland prompted a move to a larger market, and he began his new show, The Rock and Roll Party, on WINS in New York in 1954. Freed eventually organized a traveling concert show featuring Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly called The Big Beat, produced several rock-and-roll themed movies (including Rock Around the Clock (1956) and Don't Knock the Rock (1957)), and hosted a television show called Dance Party. His career ended on a sour note when he was the target of a Congressional investigation over receiving bribes in return for playing particular records. He was found guilty of bribery, or 'payola,' in 1962 and he died of kidney failure in 1965.",

In response, white artists and record companies began releasing cover versions of black artists' songs. In general, a cover version refers to a song that is re-recorded by another artist. During the age of early rock and roll, however, these cover versions had a very specific purpose: to modify black artists' rhythm and blues songs in order to make them more appropriate for white audiences. The sexual references in the original black version were muted, modified, or deleted entirely. Recordings by the squeaky-clean white singer Pat Boone exemplify the goals of early cover versions. Boone's covers of 'Ain't That a Shame' (Fats Domino), 'Long Tall Sally' (Little Richard), and 'Tutti Frutti' (Little Richard) were all more commercially successful than the original black versions. Bill Haley was one of the first white artists to achieve commercial success with crossover versions of rhythm and blues songs. His version of 'Shake, Rattle, and Roll' (1954) was a sanitized version of Big Joe Turner's original, and his recording of 'Rock Around the Clock' (1955) was the first rock-and-roll recording to become a number one hit on the pop charts.",
